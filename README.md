##Roadmap

[Full roadmap](https://github.com/trevorsargent/voya.js/projects/1) is available, but here are the highlights

 - [x] transition to functional programming style (mostly done on this, please [open an issue](https://github.com/trevorsargent/voya.js/issues/new) if there are any elements you see need fixing - i'm still learning a lot...)   
 - [x] implement 'hand-held' light sources, and the necessity thereof
 - [ ] support multiple lines of 'look around' text, to add to story, and customizable settings for its display
 - [x] re-introduce locking mechanisms on locations, and keys on the player
 - [x] support custom commands titles - a game could retitle the 'walk' command to 'swim' or 'fly' or simply 'go'... etc.





##Carnival

Carnival is the test scenario for Voya.js at the moment.

you're dropped off in the parking lot of what looks to be a very sad carnival.  enter if you want, but there's not much else around.  go on. explore. we'll wait for you. for a little while at least.

scenarios are interchangeable and customizable, and of course open to any and all who wish to write one. implementation for external files is coming soon. See the file description below (or study the `/roms` to write your own
