##Scenario

you're dropped off in the parking lot of what looks to be a very sad carnival.  enter if you want, but there's not much else around.  go on. explore. we'll wait for you. for a little while at least

##Roadmap

right now there's not a lot of funcitonality. wander around if you like, it's pretty empty.
